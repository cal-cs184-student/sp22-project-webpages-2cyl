    <h3 align="middle">Task 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

    <p> We implemented de Casteljau's algorithm for Bezier curves by recursively solving for the control points of
      the curve at each subdivision level. We then used the control points to draw the curve. At each recursion step, we
      lerp'ed between every two points in the current points vector to get the new control points until there was only
      one point left. The lerp function is as follows, where /(t/) is the tuning parameter, a and b are the two points
      to
      lerp between.

      $$lerp(t, a, b) = a + t * (b - a)$$

    <br>An attempt was made to use OpenMP <code> #pragma omp for </code> commands before for loops to speed up our
    calculations, but the timing results showed no noticeable improvement.
    <p>
      We also brainstormed an idea of speeding up rasterization using a sliding tile method.
      In this method, we would loop from the left until a find a point within the triangle then loop
      from the right until a find a point within the triangle. Then we know that every point between
      these two is inside the triangle and we can skip the arithmetic. This would save us computation roughly
      equal to sampling every point within the triangle.

    <h3 align="middle">Task 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>

    <p>In the next part of our project, we implemented supersampling on top of our basic triangle rasterization.
      Supersampling is useful for antialiasing in images. Often times we get jaggies and unwanted sharp edges on our
      image. This can be solved by sampling more than we need, then downsampling by averaging to ‘smooth out’ the
      jaggedness. The more samples we take, the less jaggies the end result has.
      <br><br>We made several changes to our rendering pipeline to accommodate supersampling. First, all functions that
      resize the temporary sample buffer had to get a multiplication factor by our sample rate to fit all of our
      samples. In our rasterization function, <code>RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle()</code>, we nested two more for
      loops to take more samples at each pixel location. Again, to obtain the center of each subpixel, we had to add an
      increment to each point.

    <p>
      <br>
      In order to downsample our sample buffer, <code>RasterizerImp::resolve_to_framebuffer()</code> was modified to
      average out every <code>sample_rate</code> number of points into one color, before inserting into the final RGB
      frame buffer array. Our results successfully showed that supersampling decreased the amount of jaggies as the
      sampling rate was increased.

    <h3 align="middle">Task 4: Edge Flip</h3>
    <p>Barycentric coordinates are special homogeneous coordinates that can help us get smooth transition values for the
      colors in our triangles when rasterizing. We can linearly interpolate (aka lerp) between each pair of vertices’
      associated color. The image below shows a smooth blended color triangle. The vertices of the triangle are pure
      RGB colors, and as we move away from the vertices, the colors become a blend of the 3 colors with each color
      intensity proportional to the distance away from the vertices. The circle below is also an interpolation across
      color hues and darkness values.
    </p>

    <p>
      We build upon our previous rasterization algorithm by adding the ability to rasterize interpolated color
      triangles. Based on the location in the triangle, we solve for the color ratios: \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and
      \(\gamma\), before multiplying them with their respective colors to obtain the final color values in the triangle.

      $$V = \alpha V_A + \beta V_B + \gamma V_C$$

    <h3 align="middle">Task 5: Edge Split</h3>
    <p>Pixel sampling is mapping pixels from one image to another (can be differing sizes).</p>
    <p>We implemented pixel sampling for texture mapping by taking the color at the (u, v)
      coordinate in our texture map and mapping it to the (x, y) coordinate in our screen space.
      The two sampling methods we implemented are nearest sampling and bilinear sampling.</p>
    <p>Nearest sampling simply outputs the color of the nearest pixel. This is done by rounding the (u, v) coordinate.
    </p>
    <p>Bilinear sampling takes the 4 nearest sample locations and returns a weighted average color based on location.
      This is
      done through linear interpolation vertically, horizontally, and finally between the previous results.</p>

    <p>
      <br>
      We observed some differences between the two sampling methods. Bilinear sampling tends to give a blurrier result
      due to averaging out values, which we can see in the images above. Nearest sampling only clips to the closest
      color for a pixel result, which results in sharper edges in the images, but also more jaggies. In terms of
      computation, bilinear will be more costly. This is especially true when computing images of large dimension for
      bilinear sampling, since we are sampling four times as many locations, and also performing three lerps to obtain a
      weighted average final result.
    </p>
    <p>
      On images with lower resolution, there will be large differences since nearest ignores surrounding pixels with an
      already low sample size.
      On images with larger resolutions, these differences are less noticeable since averages become less useful with
      larger sample sizes.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3 align="middle">Task 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
    <p>A mipmap is a data structure containing images in which each is a lower resolution (usually ½ the height and
      width) of the previous image. In this application, we store a texture in our mipmap. Level sampling is simply
      sampling from a “level” of a mipmap. As discussed in lecture we can choose a good
      mipmap level with the following formula.

      $$L = max(\sqrt{(\frac {du}{dx})^2 + \frac{dv}{dx})^2}, \sqrt{(\frac {du}{dy})^2 + \frac{dv}{dy})^2})$$
      $$D = \log_2(L)$$

    <p>
      Our implementation allows us to sample from level 0, the nearest level found by the formula, and a
      weighted average of adjacent levels found by the formula.

<p>
  From our image comparison, we think L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR gives the best results. This is expected as it is almost
  trilinear filtering.
</p>
<p>Supersampling had powerful antialiasing results, but we found that at high sample rates, the images feel too smooth
  and blurred out sometimes. Supersampling uses the most memory and also is the slowest.</p>

<p>Level sampling with a mip map has more subtle antialiasing results. It requires 4/3 times the amount of memory and
  was slower than pixel sampling.</p>

<p>Pixel sampling had great antialiasing results. It requires the least amount of memory and also performed the
  quickest.</p>

<p>We thought that pixel sampling gave the best tradeoffs between antialiasing and memory/speed.</p>

<p>To create this image, we fed a png into <a href=https://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/

  However,
  the svgparser included in this project only supports colors given in hex while Geometrize outputs colors in the format
  "rgb(r,g,b)" so we had to edit it in <code>svgparser.cpp</code> to allow support for this format.
