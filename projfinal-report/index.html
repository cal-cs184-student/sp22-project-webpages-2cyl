  <br>
  <h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    In our final project, we aim to create a fluid simulation using the Material Point Method. This method is considered a hybrid method that combine influences from both particle and grid based approaches. The MPM method features the calculation of spatial derivatives like grid based solvers for stability, and particle masses to discretize the simulation system and representing unknown variables, similar to particle based solvers.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Many common simulations methods use either a Langrangian approach (particle based) or a
    Eulerian approach (grid based). MPM uses both as it first maps particles to the grid, does grid calculations, then maps the grid back to the particles and finally particle calculations are done. We mainly referenced
    <a href="https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/papers/CGF-2018-mpm-fluid-solid.pdf"> this</a> paper for our technical approach.

  </p>
  <p>
    To interpolate from particle to cell or from cell to particle, we use the unifiorm GIMP as our shape function N
    defined below.
    $$N_{I}(x_{j}) =
    S_{I}(\frac{|x_{j,x}-x_{I,x}|}{h})S_{I}(\frac{|x_{j,y}-x_{I,y}|}{h})S_{I}(\frac{|x_{j,z}-x_{I,z}|}{h})$$

    $$S_I(x)=
    \begin{cases}
    \frac{7-16x^{2}}{16} & x\leq .25 \\
    1-x & .25 < x\leq .75 \\ \frac{(5-4x)^{2}}{16} & .75 < x\leq 1.25 \\ 0 & otherwise \end{cases}$$ <p>
      where \(x_{j}\) is the position of the partcle, \(x_{j,d}\) is the position in a dimension where \(d\) is \(x\), \(y\), or \(z\), \(x_{I}\) is the
      position of the cell, and h is the grid size.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now decribe our algorithm pipeline for implementing MPM fluid simulation. In each simulation step, we first began by clearing the cell. Cell mass and momentum are set to zero.
  </p>
  <h4 align="middle">Particle to Grid</h4>
  <p>
    Next loop through all particles
    and calculate the mass and momentum for the corresponding cell using the equations below.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$m_{I} = \sum_{j \in H_I}m_{j}N_{I}(x_j)$$
    \(m_{I}\) is the mass of the cell, j is a particle in the vicinity of the cell, \(m_j\) is the particle mass, and \(N_I\) is the shape function defined above. In our code, we define collecting the neighboring particles in the
    vicinity of one particle as a smoothing kernel with diameter of 2, which yields collecting 8 nearby particles.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$p_{I} = \sum_{j \in H_I}v_{j}m_{j}N_{I}(x_j)$$
    \(p_{I}\) is the momentum of the cell. This equation is similar except we include the velocity of the particles ss well.
  </p>
  <h4 align="middle">Fluid and Grid Calculations</h4>
  <p>
    Once we have mapped our particles to cells, we want to do our grid calculations. Liquids are considered
    incompressible so we solve the following differential equations that govern non-viscous fluids.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$ \frac{D\rho}{Dt} = 0 $$

    $$ \rho\frac{Du}{Dt}=-\Delta p + \rho g$$

    where \(\rho\) is the density, u is the velocity, and p is the pressure, and g is external body forces.
  </p>
  <p>
    A solution to the differential equations above is given below.
  </p>
  <p>
    We first want to calculate the fluid density of each cell. This is done by looping through every particle
    within the vicinity of the cell.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$\rho(x)=\sum_{j \in H}\frac{m_{j}N_{I}(x_{j})}{V_{j}}$$
    \(\rho\) is the fluid density, x is the position of the cell, j is a particle within the vicinity of the cell,
    \(m_{j}\) is the mass of the particle, and \(V_{j}\) is the volume of the particle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the fluid density allows us to calculate the fluid pressure of each particle using the weakly compressible
    eqaution.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$ p_{i}=k_{s}((\frac{\rho_i}{\bar{\rho}})^7 - 1)$$
    where \(p_{i}\) is the fluid pressure of a particle, \(k_{s}\) is the stiffness coefficient, \(\rho_{i}\) is the
    fluid
    density, and \(\bar{\rho}\) is the rest density.
  </p>
  Finally we can calculate the pressure forces that act upon the cells.
  <p>
    $$ f_{I, pressure}=\sum_{j \in H_{i}}\frac{m_j}{\rho_j}p_j\Delta N_{I}(x_j)$$
    where \(f_{I}\), pressure is the pressure force, \(m_{j}\) is the particle mass, \(\rho_{j}\) is the fluid
    density, \(p_{j}\) is the fluid pressure, and \(\Delta N_{I}\) is the gradient of the shape function.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also apply external forces now such as gravity to each node.
  </p>
  <h4 align="middle">Grid to Particles</h4>
  <p>
    We now map the cell values to particles. The velocity and acceleration of particles are given below.
    This is calculated by looping through the particles and summing up values of cells in its vicinity.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$a_{i} = \sum_{J \in H_I}\frac{f_{J}N_{J}(x_i)}{m_{J}}$$
    where \(F_{J}\) is the sum of the forces that act upon cell J and \(m_{J}\) is the mass of the cell
  </p>
  <p>
    $$u_{i} = \sum_{J \in H_I}\frac{p_{J}N_{J}(x_i)}{m_{J}}$$
  </p>
  <h4 align="middle">Particle Calculations</h4>
  <p>
    We can now do our particle calculations to determine the position of the particle.
  </p>
  <p>
    To calculate the new velocity, we use the following equations.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$\bar{u_{i}}=a_{i}dt+u_{i}^{old}$$
    $$ u_{i}^{new}=\alpha u_{i}+(1 - \alpha)\bar{u}_{i}$$
    where \(\alpha\) is .05 to give more weight towards the updated velocity for a more realistic fluid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the position is updated using
  </p>
  <p>$$ x^{t + \Delta t}=x^{t}+\Delta tu^{new}$$</p>
  </p>

  <h2 align="middle">Difficulties and Lessons learned</h2>
  <p>
    Our biggest difficulties is that our fluids are not incompressible as shown below.
  </p>

  </table>

  <div align="middle">
    <img src="images/both.gif" align="middle" width="400px">
    <figcaption align="middle">Both Gravity and Pressure Forces</figcaption>
  </div>

  <p>
    As we can see, gravity seems to be working as intended while the pressure forces do not. This pressure force seems to be
    stronger than gravity and pulls everything in a (-, -, -) direction. An explanation of this can be from the f_I, pressure equation
    where we take the gradient of the shape function. Notice that the shape function returns either 0 or a positive value but the derivatives
    of it returns either 0 or a negative value. This could explain why this force seems to pull in the (-, -, -) direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fluid section of the paper is a bit handwavy so it's possible that we misunderstand it. This paper requires a lot of physics
    knowledge which we don't have a background in. We may have had a better time if we chose a less physics demanding project.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike ClothSim where we just had to implement the physics and shaders, we had to directly interact with OpenGL; however, we had issues with NanoGui's OpenGL. Our first issue was that with a large number of particles,
    drawing spheres would be extremely demanding and the program would crash with about 5000 spheres.
  </p>

  <div align="middle">
    <img src="images/bad.png" align="middle" width="400px">
    <figcaption align="middle">The collision plane seems to follow and scale with our spheres???</figcaption>
  </div>

  <p>
    To remedy this, we decided to draw a simple triangle for each particle. This allowed us to draw
    about 30,000 particles without any issue. This also fixed the problem where the plane would follow the first particle.
  </p>

  <p>
    The OpenGL that NanoGui uses is missing a lot of functionality. For instance fundamental OpenGL constants like GL_MODELVIEW_MATRIX
    were not defined. This also made many online OpenGL tutorials useless since they would not build. We couldn't find any solutions to this
    and moved on to more important things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learning how to use the many libraries such as CGL and Eigen proved to be difficult. The skeleton code uses them both which is a bit confusing.
    Some of these issues could have been fixed if we used something such as the Taichi where the GUI and matrix data structures are built in so
    we could directly focus on the physics implementation.
  </p>

  <h2 align="middle">Results</h2>
  <h4 align="middle">Compressibility</h4>
  <p>
    While we unfortately could not figure out how to keep the fluid incompressible by not allowing particle
    clumping,
    we do have some interesting compressible fluids. By changing some constants such as the grid size, or KS we have
    some differing results.

  <p>
    Note that there is a 2x2x2 bounding box where the particles stay in. If we had more time we could have
    made it visible. The plane is located on the bottom of the bounding box it is smaller so particles look like they float.
