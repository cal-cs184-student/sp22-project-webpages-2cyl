    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to simulate fluids of various viscosity using Material Point Method by
      extending the Cloth Simulator codebase. Materials are represented as a collection
      of material points in which Newtonian Laws are applied upon.

    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      When researching various types of fluid simulations, we learned that there are mainly two types - particle
      solvers
      and grid based solvers. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Particle based techniques tend to be
      faster
      than grid based simulations, while grid based techniques are better at generating smooth water surfaces.
      Eventually we
      found a paper that took the strengths of both solvers and combined the hybrid particle and grid based solver
      into the technique
      of Material Point Method (MPM), which gave inspiration for our project. In particular, we plan to implement the
      strength of the grid
      based solver, which is using a background mesh for calculating spatial derivatives, in order to yield more
      accurate and stable results
      compared to the particle solver. MPM would also maintain mass conservation through momentum equations, which
      tend to be a downfall of typical
      grid based fluid simulations. Our main reference research paper also includes considerations and equations for
      addressing interactions between multiple fluids and solids, which we hope to accomplish implementing if
      feasible.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
    <p>
      As a baseline, we plan to accomplish getting single phase fluid simulation working, including a demo with
      adjustable GUI for changing parameters
      such as viscosity of the fluid, and simulation speed. The demonstration would allow changing the amount of
      fluid, and shape of the box that holds
      the fluid. Shaders will be implemented to allow the option to visualize the fluid as water, such as in low
      viscosity fluid, or as thick lava, such
      as in high viscosity fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a stretch goal, we hope to include fluid solid coupling behavior, multiple fluid simulation, and smoke
      simulation as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have time, we also plan on trying to utilize multithreading with OpenMP and the GPU using Cuda. We could
      then compare a naive solution with multiprocessing and GPU and observe the speedups.
      This could help us answer in which scenarios the CPU or the GPU performs better than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the quality of our system can also be measured by its visual realism and similarity to actual
      fluids
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
    <h4>Week 1</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Familiarize ourselves with MPM through reading papers and reading source code for similar existing projects
      </li>
      <li>Brainstorm and set up the new files we need to add to Cloth Sim for the project, and have an idea of what
        new functions we will implement, and how they will interact with each other</li>
      <li>Divide roles for who is working on which sub-part, and have some skeleton code done</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Week 2</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Start coding for each member’s assigned portions more extensively</li>
      <li>Have basic MVP showing, able to display moving particles within a box</li>
      <li>Can have inefficient but easier to implement algorithms</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Week 3</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic single phase fluid simulation working, able to generate dam break example (block of resting water
        suddenly dropping on to platform below, and shows splashing)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Week 4</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fluid solid coupling behavior, multiple fluid simulation, smoke simulation thorough adjusting input
        parameters and number of distinct solid/ fluid type</li>
      <li>Optimization of algorithms - if time, then can also compare simulation times of different methods</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2 align="middle">Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Our main research paper for reference is titled
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13523"> “MPM simulation of interacting fluids and solids.”</a>
      We plan to use our Cloth Sim project as a base to build on top of, so the project will be in C++ and GLSL.
      If we have time, we can try speeding up our implementation with OpenMP and we could even try using a GPU by
      incorporating CUDA. If this doesn’t work out we can try Unity.
    </p>
    Another reference we have found has an MPM simulation done in 2D using
    <a href="https://github.com/nialltl/incremental_mpm">Unity</a>, so we have also brainstormed
    extending the simulation to 3D as a possibility. Upsides of this include ease
    of importing and arranging assets, and lots of built in physics in the engine.
    A downside is that members of our team would have a steeper learning curve compared
    to starting out with a familiar language.
    <p>
      We hope to use GPU hardware (RTX 2070, 8GB GDDR6) to take advantage of GPU parallelization.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for other resources, the paper
      <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~cffjiang/research/mpmcourse/mpmcourse.pdf">“The Material Point Method for
        Simulating Continuum Materials”</a>
      is an in-depth overview of the technique which can help us gain background knowledge. However, the paper assumes
      basic knowledge of
      continuum mechanics, so here are
      <a href="https://csml.berkeley.edu/Notes/ME185.pdf"> “notes”</a>
      from Berkeley’s continuum mechanics class,
      ME 185, for referencing if needed.

      <a href="https://github.com/yuanming-hu/taichi_mpm">This</a> is written in Taichi, which is a python-like
      language used for high performance graphics. It seems really cool but we think learning this new language might
      not be feasible for the project, or dig into our time too much and interfere with accomplishing a polished final
      product.
