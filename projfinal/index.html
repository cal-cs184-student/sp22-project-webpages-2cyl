    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
    <p> 
      We aim to simulate fluids of various viscosity using Material Point Method by 
      extending the Cloth Simulator codebase. Materials are represented as a collection 
      of material points in which Newtonian Laws are applied upon.

    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      When researching various types of fluid simulations, we learned 
      that there are mainly two types - particle solvers and grid based solvers. 
      Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Eventually we found a paper 
      that took the strengths of both solvers and used a hybrid particle and grid based solver, which gave inspiration for our project.

    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
    <p>
      hi
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
    <h4>Week 1</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Familiarize ourselves with MPM through reading papers and reading source code for similar existing projects</li>
        <li>Brainstorm and set up the new files we need to add to Cloth Sim for the project, and have an idea of what new functions we will implement, and how they will interact with each other</li>
        <li>Divide roles for who is working on which sub-part, and have some skeleton code done</li>
      </ul> 
    <h4>Week 2</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Start coding for each member’s assigned portions more extensively</li>
        <li>Have basic MVP showing, able to display moving particles within a box</li>
        <li>Can have inefficient but easier to implement algorithms</li>
      </ul> 
    <h4>Week 3</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic single phase fluid simulation working, able to generate dam break example (block of resting water suddenly dropping on to platform below, and shows splashing)</li>
      </ul> 
    <h4>Week 4</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fluid solid coupling behavior, multiple fluid simulation, smoke simulation thorough adjusting input parameters and number of distinct solid/ fluid type</li>
        <li>Optimization of algorithms - if time, then can also compare simulation times of different methods</li>
      </ul> 
      <br>
    <h2 align="middle">Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Our main research paper for reference is titled 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13523"> “MPM simulation of interacting fluids and solids.”</a>
      We plan to use our Cloth Sim project as a base to build on top of, so the project will be in C++ and GLSL. 
      If we have time, we can try speeding up our implementation with OpenMP and we could even try using a GPU by 
      incorporating CUDA. If this doesn’t work out we can try Unity.
    </p>
      Another reference we have found has an MPM simulation done in 2D using 
      <a href="https://github.com/nialltl/incremental_mpm">Unity</a>, so we have also brainstormed 
      extending the simulation to 3D as a possibility. Upsides of this include ease
       of importing and arranging assets, and lots of built in physics in the engine. 
       A downside is that members of our team would have a steeper learning curve compared 
       to starting out with a familiar language.
    <p>
      We hope to use GPU hardware (RTX 2070, 8GB GDDR6) to take advantage of GPU parallelization. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As for other resources, the paper 
      <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~cffjiang/research/mpmcourse/mpmcourse.pdf">“The Material Point Method for Simulating Continuum Materials”</a>
      is an in-depth overview of the technique which can help us gain background knowledge. However, the paper assumes basic knowledge of 
      continuum mechanics, so here are 
      <a href="https://csml.berkeley.edu/Notes/ME185.pdf"> “notes”</a>
      from Berkeley’s continuum mechanics class, 
      ME 185, for referencing if needed.

      High-performance moving least squares material point method (MLS-MPM) solver. (ACM Transactions on Graphics, SIGGRAPH 2018)
      <a href="https://github.com/yuanming-hu/taichi_mpm">This</a> is written in Taichi, which is a python-like language used for high performance graphics. It seems really cool but we think learning this new language might not be feasible for the project, or dig into our time too much and interfere with accomplishing a polished final product.
